# Fuzzy
This is a repository for the development of my Fuzzy controlled robot. 
Fuzzy_Turn.py is the most functional control code
Unfuzzy is a simple code which just turns away from obsticles. 
the robot has 6 Ultrasonic sensors and a compas, the motors are pwm and can go forward and backwards,
a function is provided that groups the left and right motors togther
